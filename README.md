This project was done with ReactJS, and node.js.
It consists of the registration of developers and companies.
So that developers can request a reservation at the companies!

I used the rocketseat "unform" library to handle forms in a very simple way

1 - To run the back end made with node just type in the yarn dev console
2 - To run web app just type yarn start
